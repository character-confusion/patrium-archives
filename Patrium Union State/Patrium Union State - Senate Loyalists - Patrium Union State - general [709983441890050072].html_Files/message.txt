A marine shapes a charge of C4 to cut through solid steel at a demolitions range
The British used a plastic explosive during World War II as a demolition charge. The specific explosive, Composition C, was 88.3% RDX and 11.7% non-oily, non-explosive plasticizer.[7] The material was plastic between 0 and 40 degrees C, but was brittle at colder temperatures and gummy at higher temperatures. Composition C was superseded by Composition C2, which used a mixture of 80% RDX and 20% plasticizer. Composition C2 had a wider temperature range at which it remained plastic, from −30 to 52 degrees C. Composition C2 was replaced by Composition C3, which was a mixture of 77% RDX and 23% explosive plasticizer.[8]:8–109 C3 was effective but proved to be too brittle in cold weather and was replaced with C4. There are three classes of C4, with varying amounts of RDX and polyisobutylene.[8]:8–111

information pertaining to the type of plastic explosive should also be uncovered

Alright.
SatiristicWretchToday at 20:26
if they cant be homemade that means the culprit must have imported or bought them
from a foreign company
a special order would be required
i think the picture you used for the explosives would act as evidence
may i see it?
or could it be sent in public chat?
also
the plastic explosives were bought in small quantity
that would stand out in the company's registry of purchases
would this be useful to the military council/investigative committee?
Frog (The Toad)Today at 20:31
Unless they we're illegal smuggled in by both the company and group.
Yes, I'll inform  them.
SatiristicWretchToday at 20:32
smuggled in how
we are an island
like on ships?
if yes then we can check which senate members visited the ship ports
or the air ports if by air
Frog (The Toad)Today at 20:33
Maybe. Though nothing has been founded out. Like I said, MC is currently trying to catch all of ACA, and the other terrosists.
That's their current priority.

in my country you require a passport to get into the air ports
i have never used ships for foreign travel
but similar policy should apply
Frog (The Toad)Today at 20:34
They don't need a passport, if they pay off the ship workers and captain.
SatiristicWretchToday at 20:34
we pay them more
plus whistleblower protection act
if they reveal anything they are protected by the government
i hope this will be considered by mc/ic
will it?
Frog (The Toad)Today at 20:43
I'll definitely bring it up to them.
