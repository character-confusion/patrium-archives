Step 1: Conceal small pellet bombs(as a bead necklace), tranquilizer darts(with their nibs encased)/a silenced gun(with trigger encased) and a make up kit in such a way they wont be detected by a patting down (arksiane informed me about patting down)
Step 2: "Accidentally" get arrested by junta
Step 3: if they dont specifically ask for spec ops to inspect me:
		victory royale, smuggled in, continue to Step 4
	if they do:
		reveal pellet bombs and blow up the walls of prison, freeing prisoners for epicness points, and escaping myself (also potentially killing their generals)
Step 4: when in prison overturn the bed and lay myself in foetal position between the wall and the bed, such that the part on which one lays on the bed faces outward. at the same time, act deranged and say stuff like "I cant die.. What am I gonna do... aaaaa...AAAAAA"

Step 5: wait to be questioned

Step 6: once guards and general(s) come, wait for one general to lean over me as I lay in foetal position

Step 7: whisper to them 1: some fake shit and then 2: tell them that may have a backstabber working for other coalitions, and because they could get away if i told their name out loud, ask other generals (if there are any) and guards to leave room

		if they do so: 
			victory royale, deceit achieved, continue to step 8
		if they dont:
			they work with fake info + start doubting their members coz they dont have a name, causing disunity
		if they dont and press for more info:
			i kick leaning general in crotch, and throw bombs outwards, using bed as cover, generals are either incapacitated or kil+liberate prison for epicness points

Step 8: once others have left, and cell door is closed, (as it is detention camp, it doesnt have bars), i either use tranquiliser to put them to sleep, or gun to put them to death
Step 9: disguise myself as them and use makeup kit so that i look like them on first glance/ if my face is hidden
Step 10: i steal their wallet and keys, i partly hide my face by constantly looking down(as if i am disappointed) and hiding the rest of my face with generals  cap i go outside and tell guards to
		if i tranquilised:
			throw other general in, while pushing him, i stab him with tranquiliser
		if i assassinated:
			either execute him on the spot or throw him in and let him die of starvation, and not let him out (if i throw him in, i use tranq)
Step 11: i give all money from the wallet to the soldiers, tell them that they are free men (at this point prison door is locked from outside), since they are soldiers whose job is to follow orders, they accept

Step 12: as i have access to junta plans, i steal them, and burn/delete all other copies (this also applies to finances etc)

Step 13: use pellet bombs and blow up the walls of prison, freeing prisoners for epicness points, and escaping myself



since geneva convention is kil, no worry for geneva related war crimes

Results: Dead generals (via gun/poison dart instead of tranq dart, starvation)
	 leaked info, purging their access to the sae (if ozy doesnt allow info purging for them, its ok)
	 Epicness points (this is for the haha funny, i know it wont impact anything)
