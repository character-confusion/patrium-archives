how much are a r e a w i d e c a m o and dummy tanks+ghost armies gonna cost?
OzymandiasFRToday at 10:42
hmmm depends, how many units are you covering? How large is the area?
SatiristicWretchToday at 10:43
could you give a rate
OzymandiasFRToday at 10:44
one unit should cost around 100 to hide effectively
SatiristicWretchToday at 10:44
and dummy tanks+ghost armies?
OzymandiasFRToday at 10:44
each "dummy" unit will cost 500
it's supposed to be expensive
SatiristicWretchToday at 10:45
what if we convert a milita to work as ghost armies?
or any other unit?
dummys can be made with just inflatables
or wood
OzymandiasFRToday at 10:46
that would mean you couldn't use the militia unit anymore you know that right
?
SatiristicWretchToday at 10:46
ot haybales and cloth
OzymandiasFRToday at 10:46
modern surveillance would most likely need to be fooled by better forms of dummies.
idk about converting units into dummies
SatiristicWretchToday at 10:47
not from high up
OzymandiasFRToday at 10:47
I think it would
with satellites and all
or really advanced planes
SatiristicWretchToday at 10:47
but thats gonna cost more money right?
OzymandiasFRToday at 10:48
well that is the expected default form of surveillance
high tech planes
SatiristicWretchToday at 10:48
lemme research a bit
about development of air surveillance
Current use

A DeltaQuad VTOL fixed wing surveillance UAV [8]
Unmanned (UAV) surveillance aircraft have been "deployed or are under development in many countries, including Israel, the UK, the United States, Canada, China, India, South Africa and Pakistan." [9]Drones are increasingly used in conservation work to complete tasks such as mapping forest cover, tracking wildlife, and enforcing environmental laws by catching illegal loggers or poachers.[10]

Unmanned surveillance UAVs include both airships—such as Sky Sentinel[11] and HiSentinel 80[12]—and airplanes.

Most air forces around the world lack dedicated surveillance planes.[citation needed]

Several countries adapt aircraft for electronic intelligence (ELINT) gathering. The Beech RC-12 Super King Air and Boeing RC-135 Rivet Joint are examples of this activity.[13]
A very common area of ELINT is intercepting radars and learning their locations and operating procedures. Attacking forces may be able to avoid the coverage of certain radars, or, knowing their characteristics, electronic warfare units may jam radars or send them deceptive signals. Confusing a radar electronically is called a "soft kill", but military units will also send specialized missiles at radars, or bomb them, to get a "hard kill". Some modern air-to-air missiles also have radar homing guidance systems, particularly for use against large airborne radars.
yeah i dont think modern surveillance is that much epic
i mean in india we managed to fool us satellites
OzymandiasFRToday at 10:53
okay well my numbers stay the same
SatiristicWretchToday at 10:53
with a construction sign on the ground
during nuclear tests
so i dont think modern surveillance is that epic
OzymandiasFRToday at 10:55
okay, if you want to cover stuff it will cost 100/unit to hide effectively. If you want to use dummies it will cost 500/unit

i mean this is modern surveillance
and
a)its all black and white
and
b)they managed to mistake civilians for armed terrorists
so yeah
i still think cost should be less
so any change in your rates or nah?
