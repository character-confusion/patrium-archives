[Intro: Ray William Johnson]
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin', doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
You know we straight, doin', doin' your mom

[Hook: Ray William Johnson]
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin', doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
You know we straight, doin', doin' your mom
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin', doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
You know we straight, doin', doin' your mom

[Verse 1: Micfri & Ray William Johnson]
I'm doin' your mom. Yes, yours!
First saw her in the Walmart pickin' out your drawers
Big Dolly Parton hair like an '80s prom queen
But her ass was lookin' good all up in them mom-jeans
I approached her in the checkout line, and said, "Yo baby, wassup?"
She had two gallons of milk, and I was starin' at her jugs
Five minutes later she agreed to get with me
So we went and rocked the minivan like giggity, giggity, giggity
I was ridin' your mom like she's Mario Kart
I gave her a lift back to her crib 'cause her car wouldn't start
She invited me in the house, and we started makin' out again
How many times I tap that ass? Over 9000!
Yeah, she called me Pledge cause I knocked the dust off it
Later made me a sandwich and she cut the crust off it
'Cause she knows how I like it, and that I'm a little young
To be in the bed, butt-naked doin' your mom

[Hook: Ray William Johnson]
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin', doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
You know we straight, doin', doin' your mom
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin', doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
You know we straight, doin', doin' your mom

[Verse 2: Ray William Johnson & Micfri]
I like your mama's big butt, and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny that she's fly
We make sexy time, yes, and every night I tap that
She saw me butt-naked, now she thinks I'm half black
Your moms the best, the super M-I-L-F
Cause she loves to toss the salad even though she ain't a chef
And I blame it on the al-al-alcohol, if I were you
I wouldn't kiss your mom on the mouth at all
She likes the Donkey-Punch. She likes the Dirty Sanchez
Sometimes she even likes to fool around in your bed
She likes rough sex with handcuffs and I'll be honest
She likes me to Chris Brown her when she acts like Rihanna
She's so therapeutic, when I need to cure my restlessness
I say br-br-br-br-br-br-br-br, motorboat your moms breastestess
I didn't wanna tell you, but I had to write this song
'Cause I'm in your house every night doin your mo-om

[Hook: Ray William Johnson]
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin', doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
You know we straight, doin', doin' your mom
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin', doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
You know we straight, doin', doin' your mom

[Bridge: Breeze The Beat Machine]
Sex with your mother
And that makes me better (Better) better than you
I'm having sex with your mother
And that makes me better (Better) better than you

[Guitar Solo]

[Hook: Ray William Johnson]
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin', doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
You know we straight, doin', doin' your mom
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
Doin', doin' your mom, doin', doin' your mom
You know we straight, doin', doin' your mom
